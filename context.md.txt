# 24-Hour Power Outage Forecasting System  

## 1. Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered early warning system** that predicts **power outages 24 hours in advance** using **weather data** and **power grid data**. The aim is to transform outage handling from reactive to **proactive**, enabling utilities and citizens to prepare before outages occur.  

Unlike basic prediction systems, this solution is a **decision-intelligence tool** that:  
- Predicts outages with **risk scores + confidence levels**.  
- Explains **why** the risk exists (e.g., "High winds + IMD alert = 72% risk in Bengaluru").  
- Pinpoints **risk locations on an interactive map** (GIS visualization).  
- Provides **plain-language advisories** for utilities and the public.  
- Offers an **interactive what-if simulator** to test hypothetical scenarios.

## 2. Problem Statement  
Power outages during severe weather (monsoon storms, lightning) are common. Current systems only respond **after** outages happen, causing economic loss, operational chaos, and public safety issues.  
There is **no reliable, scalable early-warning system** that combines weather forecasts, grid data, and explainable AI to **predict, localize, and advise**.  

---

## 3. Solution Approach  
1. **Data-Driven Forecasting** – Use historical outage data + real-time weather forecasts + IMD alerts.  
2. **ML Model** – Hybrid architecture:  
   - LSTM for time-series weather sequences.  
   - XGBoost/LightGBM for tabular features.  
   - Ensemble for final outage risk score.  
3. **Explainability** – Feature attribution (SHAP) to provide "why" explanations.  
4. **Geospatial Visualization** – Map-based risk heatmap and pinpointing during heavy rain/lightning warnings.  
5. **Actionable Advisories** – AI outputs converted into natural language alerts for utilities and citizens.  
6. **What-If Simulator** – Change rainfall, wind speed, or load → see effect on outage risk.

## 4. Key Features  
- ✅ **Risk Score + Confidence** instead of binary classification.  
- ✅ **Explainability** using SHAP for feature attribution.  
- ✅ **Location Pinpointing** on map for warnings (rain, lightning, thunderstorms).  
- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard** for utilities and public.  
- ✅ **Natural Language Advisories** for citizen alerts.  
- ✅ **What-If Scenario Simulator**.

## 5. Data Sources  
- **Weather Data:** IMD, NOAA, OpenWeather API, Google Weather API.  
- **Grid Data:** Historical outage logs, maintenance schedules, SCADA export (CSV/SQL).  
- **Geospatial Data:** Shapefiles for districts (GeoJSON).  
- **Alerts:** IMD storm warnings, lightning alerts, rainfall alerts.

## 6. ML Model Design  
- **Inputs:**  
  - Rainfall (mm), wind speed, temperature, humidity, lightning strikes, storm alerts.  
  - Grid load patterns, past outage frequency, feeder/substation data.  
- **Architecture:**  
  - Preprocessing: Missing value handling, normalization, feature engineering (lag features, seasonal patterns).  
  - Model: LSTM for sequential weather → embeddings merged with grid data → fed into XGBoost ensemble.  
- **Output:**  
  - Outage Risk Score (0–100).  
  - Confidence interval.  
  - SHAP-based explanation.

## 7. System Architecture  
**Data Pipeline:**  
- Collect real-time weather & grid data (APIs, batch jobs).  
- Store in **PostgreSQL** (or **TimescaleDB** for time-series).  
- ETL with **Prefect/Airflow** for automation.  

**Model Serving:**  
- Train ML model using TensorFlow/PyTorch + XGBoost.  
- Deploy inference API using **FastAPI** (optimized for async).

  - Displays heatmap (Leaflet.js / Mapbox GL) with color-coded risk zones.  
  - Shows outage predictions, explanations, what-if simulator.  
- **Public Advisory Page:**  
  - Simplified alerts → "High outage risk in Bengaluru due to heavy rain".  

**Deployment & Scalability:**  
- Containerized with **Docker**.  
- Orchestrated via **Kubernetes** for high availability.  
- Deployed on **AWS (EC2 + S3 + RDS)** or **GCP (Compute Engine + Cloud Storage + BigQuery)**.  

**Security:**  
- HTTPS (SSL/TLS).  
- API key protection for weather/grid APIs.
